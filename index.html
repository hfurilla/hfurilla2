                    <h1>Hi, I'm Hailey!</h1>
                    <h2>Writer. Editor. Designer.</h2>
                    <p>I’m a student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst) with a certificate in Professional Writing and Technical Communication as well as a concentration in Creative Writing. As I have grown, I have applied my passion for art, reading, and writing towards the publishing industry and editorial jobs. While I seek to develop my own work, I also am eager to aid the development of other artists as they launch their careers, whether this support comes through digital marketing and graphic design, or polishing existing pieces to be published. </p>
                    <p>Currently, I am working with the University of Massachusetts Press as a Digital Marketing Intern as well as an Acquisitions Editor on the poetry section on Jabberwocky—the official undergraduate literary journal of UMass Amherst. </p>
                    <p>On an individual level, I am a columnist on the Opinion and Editorial section of the Daily Collegian and write poetry on my own time. When I’m not working, I love studying Latin, pursuing amateur stargazing, and bullet journaling. </p>
